		total soil water column is assumed to contribute to runoff DOC losses.
		
		The parameter surface soil depth can be optimized to increase or decrease the \
		importance of surface runoff DOC contributions.
		
		Im not totally satisified with this method of seperating surface and sub \
		surface DOC losses.  It would seem more logical the the the surface losses \
		would come from the unsat zone.  However, the hydro model divides \
		rain/melt into surface and sub-surface components (surface runoff is not \
